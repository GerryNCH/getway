"""
places.py — Google Places API integration (stops) + Unsplash (destination photos).

Places API (New) is used for specific named stops (hotels, restaurants,
landmarks) where it returns accurate, place-specific photos.

Unsplash is used for the destination hero/gallery, because Places API
photos for a bare city/region query are often low-quality or blurry
(user-submitted snapshots), whereas Unsplash returns curated, high-res
travel photography — exactly what a hero banner needs.

Free tier: Places $200/month credit (~5000 lookups). Unsplash: 50 req/hour
on the free Demo tier — plenty for this use case.
